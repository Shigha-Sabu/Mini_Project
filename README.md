The project addresses the growing concern of fall related injuries by developing an affordable fall detection device using an ESP32 microcontroller and MPU6050( Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor).The system collects data from the sensor and compares it to the threshold values implemented on the system. The threshold values were set after observing and calculating the mean of the fall values of several real case scenarios. For further conformation and prevention of false call detection the trunk value was also considered. If a fall is detected the system would send the location of the user to the guardian as a safety measure.
